# 🎮 Hexfields: Dominion

This is the frontend for our game **Hexfields: Dominion**, an alternative to Settlers of Catan.

Players are supposed to access this via the browser. This code is not meant for installation, rather just for development and deployment.

The game is hosted on a [GitHub Pages Website](https://hexfields-studio.github.io/HexfieldsDominion/).

## 🛠️ Development

To start the dev server:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Hexfields-Studio/HexfieldsDominion.git
cd HexfieldsDominion
bun install
bun run dev
```
