# 🎮 Siedler Frontend

This is the frontend for our game **Siedler**, an alternative to Settlers of Catan.

Players are supposed to access this via the browser. This code is not meant for installation, rather just for development and deployment.

## 🛠️ Development

To start the dev server:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Hexfeld-Studio/Siedler-Frontend.git
cd Siedler-Frontend
bun install
bun run dev
```
